# C# Methods Lab

## Overview

This repository contains a C# program that demonstrates the use of methods, specifically focusing on calculating the sum of two numbers and finding the greatest of three numbers. The code includes both return-type and non-return-type methods.

## Contents

1. **labExample1**: A method that calculates the sum of two numbers using both a return-type method and a non-return-type method.
2. **labExercise1**: A method that prompts the user to input three numbers and determines the greatest number using two different approaches.

## Features

- **Return-Type Method**: Calculates the sum and returns the result.
- **Non-Return-Type Method**: Calculates the sum and prints the result directly.
- **Finding the Greatest Number**: Uses conditional statements to determine and display the greatest of three input numbers.

## Usage

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
2. **Open the project** in a C# compatible IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. **Compile and run** the program.
4. Follow the prompts in the console to enter numbers.

### Example Input/Output

- For the sum calculation:
  ```
  Enter The Number X: 5
  Enter The Number Y: 10
  The Sum of the Result is 15
  ```
  
- For finding the greatest number:
  ```
  Enter First Number: 8
  Enter Second Number: 12
  Enter Third Number: 5
  Greater number is: 12
  ```

## Code Explanation

### labExample1

- **FunctionExampleOne**: 
  - Prompts the user for two integers.
  - Calculates and returns their sum.
  
- **FunctionExampleTwo**: 
  - Prompts the user for two integers.
  - Calculates and prints their sum without returning a value.

### labExercise1

- **TeacherFucntionFindingHighestNumber**: 
  - Prompts the user for three integers.
  - Determines and prints the greatest number using conditional statements.
  
- **MyFucntionFindingHighestNumber**: 
  - Similar to the teacher's function but uses a helper method `FindGreatestNum` to find the greatest number using `Math.Max`.

## Requirements

- .NET SDK (version 5.0 or later)
- C# compatible IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, JetBrains Rider)
